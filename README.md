Jigglypuff's Rainbow
============

Jigglypuff's rainbow is beautiful. Can you stop the pokeballs from ruining her day?

Game Instructions
--------------------

1. Hit the button to get started and catch those pokeballs.
2. If four get by you, then watch out. Jigglypuff won't like it.
3. If you miss one then you will need ot apologize.

Purpose
--------------------

This is a personal project to muck around with css3 and javascript. Jigglypuff,
pokeballs, and the rainbow are pure css from single nodes. The animation is css as well.

Javascript handles the click events.

To Do:
--------------------

* add random side to side animaton.
* add furhter responiveness.
* spruce up the environment a bit with more pokemon and pokeball animation on click.
* style the fail messages better.
* not yet fully browser tested.

Jigglypuff and pokeballs are not owned by me and are the copyrighted property of
Pok√©mon. This is a fan made project for fun and practice.
