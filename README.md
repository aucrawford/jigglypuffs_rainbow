v 1.2
--------------------
* Added Whismur
* Cleaned up animation
* Fixed Jigglypuff's ears
* expanded play field
* Updated responsive design

Game Instructions
--------------------

1. Hit the button to get started and catch those pokeballs.
2. If four get by you, then watch out. Jigglypuff won't like it.
3. If you miss one then you will need to apologize.

Purpose
--------------------

This is a personal project to muck around with css3 and javascript. Jigglypuff,
pokeballs, and the rainbow are pure css from single nodes. The animation is css
as well.

Javascript handles the click events.

To Do:
--------------------

* add random side to side pokeball animation
* add more Pokémon
* spruce up the environment a bit
* not yet fully browser tested
* add an about page

Jigglypuff Whismur and Pokéballs are not owned by me and are the copyrighted property of
The Pokémon Company. This is a fan made project for fun and practice.
